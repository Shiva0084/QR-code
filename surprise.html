            <div class="letter-title">Month 1 – “The Spark”</div>
            <p class="date">January 29 – February 28, 2025</p>
            <p>My Dearest Star,</p>

            <p>They say the best stories begin when you least expect them — and ours started in the middle of a small
                crowd, on a regular day that turned out to be anything but ordinary.</p>

            <p>Republic Day 2025 — I didn’t know you, you didn’t know me. And yet, something about that day still
                lingers in my heart. </p>

            <p>Then came <strong>29th January</strong>, the day that now holds a special place in my soul. It was just a
                brief virtual glimpse of you, but something about you stayed with me. Something warm. Something
                unforgettable. I didn’t realize it then, but that was the beginning — the first real moment where the
                spark turned into a flame.</p>

            <p>We met <strong>for the first time on 3rd February</strong>, outside the IT lab, and even though it was
                short, it was enough. That memory is etched in my heart. I still remember the butterflies, the shy
                excitement, and how my world felt just a little brighter after.</p>

            <p>Our chats grew deeper. Our connection felt easy, natural — as if our souls already knew each other. I
                found myself waiting to hear from you, to talk to you, to share even the tiniest bits of my day with
                you. And you listened — really listened — like no one ever had before.</p>

            <p>The more I got to know you, the more I realized something special was unfolding. Even when <strong>28th
                    February</strong> didn’t go as planned — even though I wanted to ask you something that day and
                everything flopped — I saw a deeper beauty in how you were just <em>you</em>. Tired, human, real — and
                still, the person I wanted to be next to.</p>

            <p>That first month? It changed everything. It lit the spark that still burns in me every single day.</p>

            <p class="signature">Love,<br>Your Pikachu 💛</p>

        <div id="letter2" class="letter">
            <div class="letter-title">Month 2 – “Getting Closer”</div>
            <p class="date">March 1 – March 31, 2025</p>
            <p>My Sweetu,</p>

            <p>If the first month was the spark, then this was when the fire truly caught on.</p>

            <p><strong>6th March 2025</strong> — I’ll never forget that day. I was nervous, clumsy, hopeful, and
                hopelessly in love. I still laugh thinking about my words:<br>
                <em>"Would you be my Ash? 😳"</em><br>
                Corny? Maybe. Sincere? Absolutely.
            </p>

            <p>And you said yes.<br>
                That moment — that <em>yes</em> — became a part of me forever.</p>

            <p>After that, everything felt warmer, more magical. Although we were far away after that but still. We
                weren’t just two people talking anymore — we were <em>us</em>. Sharing little things, comforting each
                other, talking for hours about life, dreams, random thoughts. My heart started learning a new rhythm —
                and it beat with your name.</p>

            <p>You made me feel seen. Valued. Loved. Not for anything big or dramatic, but just for being who I was. And
                I began falling — deeper than I ever imagined possible.</p>

            <p>I remember the joy of being around you. The way time would bend when we were together. Every hug, every
                smile, every silly nickname we gave each other — they became pieces of this mosaic we were slowly
                building.</p>

            <p>We were getting closer, not just in time spent but in soul. I started to understand your silences, your
                laughter, your tired eyes after long days. And somewhere in between all that, I saw the girl I wanted to
                grow with.</p>

            <p>I was no longer just me. I was <em>your</em> Deepu. Your Pikachu. Your person. And that feeling — it was
                everything.</p>

            <div class="letter-title">Month 3 – “Falling Deeper”</div>
            <p class="date">April 1 – April 30, 2025</p>
            <p>My Gunn,</p>

            <p>This month was a beautiful chaos — <em>end sems, stress, revision marathons</em> — and yet, somehow,
                amidst the madness, we created some of the most unforgettable memories of our relationship.</p>

            <p>We balanced the pressure of exams with warmth and comfort. Cheering each other on, motivating when one of
                us felt tired, reminding each other to rest, to eat, to breathe. It was exhausting — but we did it,
                together. And in doing so, we grew even closer.</p>

            <p>But you know what moment changed everything for me?</p>

            <p><strong>Our first kiss.</strong></p>

            <p>It wasn’t perfect in the cinematic sense — but it was <em>ours</em>. Honest. Raw. Magical. That moment
                still plays in my mind like my favorite movie scene — where everything goes quiet and the world
                disappears, leaving just <em>us</em>.</p>

            <p>That kiss wasn't just physical — it was a promise. A silent confession. A bridge between two hearts that
                were already falling, but now were freefalling — completely and irreversibly.</p>

            <p>This month, I understood the depth of what we had. I realized I wasn’t just falling in love — I
                <strong>was</strong> in love. Fully. Fiercely.</p>

            <p>And even in the madness of exams, your voice, your laugh, your presence — kept me sane. You became my
                calm and my spark, all at once.</p>

            <p>Here’s to kisses, to chaos, to falling deeper —<br>
                And most importantly, to <strong>you</strong>.</p>

            <div class="letter-title">Month 4 – “Growing Together”</div>
            <p class="date">May 1 – May 31, 2025</p>
            <p>My Swasu,</p>

            <p>This month wasn’t easy. Not for me — and I know, maybe not for you either.</p>

            <p>Being away from you, truly away, felt like a storm brewing in my chest every day. I tried to stay strong.
                I tried to keep my mind busy — music, classes, studies, distractions of all kinds. But no matter what I
                did, one thing stayed constant:</p>

            <p><strong>I missed you. Every single day.</strong><br>
                Not a moment passed without your name echoing somewhere in my heart.</p>

            <p> And yet, even through the distance, through all the noise and silence, there was something beautiful we
                never let go of — those little rituals, the lifelines.<br>
                <strong>Not one day went without a “Good morning” or a “Good night.”</strong><br>
                And that, in itself, is love — steady, soft, and resilient.
            </p>

            <p>There were storms in my head — doubts, fears, moments when I questioned everything.<br>
                <em>“What if I lose her?”</em><br>
                That thought haunts me sometimes. And I wish I could erase it, but maybe it’s just the cost of loving
                someone so much that the idea of losing them feels unbearable.
            </p>

            <p>But despite all the questions and chaos, one truth remained:<br>
                <strong>I don’t want anyone else. I want you. Just you.</strong>
            </p>

            <p>This month taught me how deeply I need your presence — not just physically, but emotionally, spiritually.
                I realized how much I rely on your love, your voice, your support. And how, even from miles away, you
                still manage to make my heart feel full.</p>

            <p>I know we’ve had our share of ups and downs. I know we’re still learning how to be strong from afar. But
                if growing together means facing storms like these and still choosing each other — again and again —
                then I’ll walk through every season with you.</p>

            <p>Because no matter how hard it gets, I’ll always find my way back to you.</p>

            <p>You are my comfort. My fear. My peace. My storm.<br>
                My sweetest pain and my warmest home.</p>

            <p>Let’s keep growing — together. Even in distance.<br>
                Even in doubt.</p>

            <p class="signature">With all the love I carry,<br>Your Deepu 💛</p>

            <p>My Star,</p>

            <p>As we step into our fifth month, I’m amazed by how far we’ve come — and how much more I’ve fallen for
                you, every single day. It’s crazy to think that soon we’ll be celebrating six months together. Half a
                year. Half a beautiful chapter of something I never imagined I’d be lucky enough to have.</p>

            <p>You’re special — you know that, right?<br>
                And I try, in my own ways, to remind you of that — through words, through tiny acts, through the time I
                give you from my heart. But sometimes, even amidst all this love, there are things I find hard to admit.
                Things like… insecurity.</p>

            <p>I know I’ve been a little off lately. I asked you something on <strong>3rd May</strong>, and I know it
                wasn’t the smartest way to express myself. Maybe I was scared. Maybe I was foolish. Or maybe I just love
                you so much that the fear of losing you sometimes grows too loud in my head.</p>

            <p>I’m trying, I really am. I try to stay calm, to trust, to remind myself of everything we’ve built. But
                sometimes, my heart runs ahead of me — dreaming of you, loving you deeply — and then panicking at the
                thought of not being enough.</p>

            <p>You are in my sweetest dreams — and also in my worst nightmares. That’s how much space you hold in me.
            </p>

            <p>I’ll keep trying to be better — for you, for us. And if there are moments when I stumble, when my fear
                outweighs my reason, I just ask you one thing:<br>
                <strong>Handle me with care.</strong>
            </p>

            <p>Because every boy, I think, is a little insecure for his girl — especially when she’s as rare and radiant
                as you.<br>
                You are not just my girl.<br>
                You’re my Star — made of stardust, my little universe, my miracle.</p>

            <p class="signature">With you always,<br>Your Pikachu 💛</p>

        <div id="bonusLetter" class="letter">
            <div class="letter-title">Secret Bonus Letter – “For All the Tomorrows. The One for You, and You Only”</div>
            <p>My Cutu,</p>

            <p>This isn’t just another letter. This is a part of me I rarely show. The kind that stays hidden beneath
                smiles, jokes, or even the usual “I love you.”</p>

            <p>You once said to me:<br>
                <em>“You will have to feel the pain, you will cry, but you need to have patience.”</em><br>
                And I didn’t get it then. Not fully. But now I do.
            </p>

            <p>Yes — I’ve cried. I’ve overthought. I’ve imagined hundreds of outcomes, not all of them pretty. But I’ve
                also held onto something stronger than all of that:<br>
                <strong>You. Your love. Us.</strong>
            </p>

            <p>I want to be better, truly. I want to change the parts of me that get in the way of loving you the way
                you deserve. But sometimes a scary thought slips in —
                What if, in trying to change, I lose something essential in me?
                What if I become too harsh? Too closed off? Too unlike myself?</p>

            <p>But I guess all of that… it’s just fear talking.</p>

            <p>Because deep down, I know what I want.<br>
                I want to be <strong>that one guy</strong> — the guy who earns your love, who is made for your love, who
                fits into your story so seamlessly that no one else could even try.</p>

            <p><strong>And I won’t share your love with anyone. I can’t. I won’t.</strong><br>
                Because your love feels like it was written for me — and I want to fight every part of me until I become
                the one who’s worthy of it.</p>

            <p>I don’t care how long it takes. I’ll wait. I’ll grow. I’ll break and rebuild.<br>
                But I’ll do it — because <em>you’re my endgame.</em></p>

            <p>You’re not just someone I love.<br>
                You’re the one I want to keep, protect, and hold in every version of forever.</p>
            <p>You’ve made it through every chapter — and I’ve loved you more in every word.</p>
            <p>This one isn’t tied to a month, or a moment... it’s just my forever promise to you.</p>
            <p>To the girl who turned my ordinary days into poetry — thank you.</p>
            <p>I love you. For every day ahead. ❤️</p>
            <p>Yours forever, Pikachu ⚡</p>
